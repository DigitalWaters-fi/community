> Copy the url for *your* fork. Make sure to select the correct type of authentication (HTTPS or SSH) to match the way you configured your account on the VRE before copying!

> Open a Terminal window in the VRE and clone your repository with the `git clone <url>` command, replacing `<url>` with the url you copied.

> Oops! Looks like your SSH key has insufficient permissions, and GitHub won't accept it as strong authentication! You'll need to use the `chmod` command to change the permissions

Use the following command to change the permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

> Now, you can try cloning again and it should go through (provided your SSH setup was correct). TIP -- you can get that command back in the Terminal without needing to type it again by using the up arrow!

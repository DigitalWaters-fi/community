# Use `repo2docker` to jump-start reproducibility

`repo2docker` is a utility maintained by Project Jupyter that creates stable Docker images based on [standard configuration files(https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#config-files). It is suitable for Python, R, Python and R, and Julia environments, and can also install Linux packages if needed.

In this tutorial, you will use the [`repo2docker` GitHub Action](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action/blob/master/README.md) to build a reproducible image, deploy it to to DockerHub, and the start up a container with your environment on the DIWA VRE.

1. Set up your accounts

You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?source=login), a DockerHub account, and a DIWA VRE account to complete this tutorial. You can use the GitHub Account to create both the DIWA VRE account and the DockerHub account.

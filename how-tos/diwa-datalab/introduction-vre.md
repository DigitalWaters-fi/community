# Getting started on the DIWA DataLab
The [Digital Waters](https://digitalwaters.fi) flagship and pilot, in collaboration with [CSC – Finnish Center for Informatics in Science](https://csc.fi) has developed a JupyterHub based virual reasearch environment to accelerate research, promote FAIR and Open Science best practices within the flagship, facilitate collaboration, and co-develop digital twin services.
## What is the DIWA DataLab?
A 
## Useful terms:
1. Server – The “workspace” that runs for a user, letting them access tools, write documents, and run experiments. Think of it as a personal computer in the cloud. 
2. Instance – A single active copy of that workspace. When you log in, an instance is created for you to work in. 
3. Image – A pre-packaged setup that includes the operating system and any tools you need. It’s like a pre-configured computer you can start instantly.
4. PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) – A way to save your files and data safely, even if the workspace is closed or restarted. It’s like a personal folder in the cloud. You have 500 GB of PVC with each server. Anything you save in your server will be available next time you log in, and these files can be accessed from any image.
5. Software – The applications or programs available in the image, like data analysis tools, simulation software, or text editors. You can use the images that we provide, suggest new images for us to build, or upload your own.
6. Packages – Extra add-ons or modules that expand what the software can do. For example, if the software is a drawing tool, packages might add new brushes or shapes. You can install your own packages into any image and they will be there for you next time you log in. Learn more about installing packages in the DIWA DataLab [here]
